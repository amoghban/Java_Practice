=======================


A Programming lanaguage is a medium between human and comuter

Structured Programming language 
Object Oriented  programing jangauage

01. What is Java ?
    Java is a platform independent OOPL.

    * Java is a OOPL
    * Java is Platform Independent

02. Why Java ?

	* Acheiving Platform Independendency
	* For developing internet based application

03. Who invented Java ?

	* James Gosling
	* Sun Microsystems
	* Was invented 1991

04. Types of Applications ?

    1. Stand Alone (SA) - Installed in One computer and only accessible from same amchine and not other comuter.
   		eg: Office , Anti virus , vlc
    
    2. Internet Application (IA) - Can be accessed over internet from other application
        eg: Amazon, Internet banking - HDFC , FLipkart, Facebook

	* Java can be used to devlop both SA and IA application.
	
04. Stand alone and Internet Applications

SA - Application which is installed on a computer and cannot be accessed over internet
	 Single user single access
	 installation / download is required 
	 
IA - Application which is installed on a computer and can be accessed over internet or withing same computer as well
       can access over browser

05. Platform, Platform dependency platform independency

    Platform is an environemtn (software or hardware) in which  a program is loaded and executd
    C or C++ is directly run on a OS (Paltform dependent)
    java is run on a JVM , JVM is responsible to convvert code to OS like windows,linux or mac
    
    Develop once and executr in any platform
    
    
    platform dependency:  a programmed compiled in one OS and cannot run on anohter
